# Workshop 07 - STL Algorithms

In this workshop, we use the Standard Template Libraryâ€™s algorithms to evaluate sample data.

w7.cpp was provided to us to test our code, with some portions we had to add ourselves.

These workshops are course work from OOP345 Fall 2018 at Seneca College. 

Below is a list of workshops that we are doing throughout the semester:
- [x] [From One Translation Unit to Another](https://github.com/Tibbs39/OOP345-workshop1)
- [x] [Move and Copy Semantics](https://github.com/Tibbs39/OOP345-workshop2)
